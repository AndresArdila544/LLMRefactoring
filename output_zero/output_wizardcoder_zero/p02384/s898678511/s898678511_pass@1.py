The program takes an input string containing four characters separated by spaces, then iterates over each character in the input string and checks if it matches with either 'E' or 'S', and if so, swaps its elements with those of another string 's'. If a match is found, the output is printed. This can be simplified using dictionary comprehension and list slicing to reduce the number of lines:

```python
def f(d):
    s = {'E': "310542", 'S': "402351", 'R': "031425"}
    for c in d[::-1]:  # iterate over the input string from end to start
        if c == 'E' or c == 'S':
            s_dict = {int(key): int(val) for key, val in zip(s[c], s['R'])}  # use dictionary comprehension to swap values
            d = [s_dict.get(int(x), x) for x in d]  # replace elements with swapped values or original values if not found in the dict
        elif c == 'R':
            return d[2]  # exit loop and print third element of input string when 'R' is encountered
    
for _ in range(int(input())): f([*map(str, input().split())])
```

Here's the explanation:
- The function `f` takes a list of four characters as input and swaps elements based on the value of 'S', 'E', or 'R'.
- It loops over each character in the input string from end to start.
- If the current character is 'S' or 'E', it creates a dictionary comprehension with the corresponding values from the string s using `zip` and swaps the elements of the input list d using `get`.
- When the character is 'R', it exits the loop and returns the third element of the input list.
- The final line uses the star operator to unpack the list returned by `input().split()` into individual variables for each element. 
- The loop iterates over this new list using a generator expression, and applies the `f` function to each element in turn.
