```python
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
print((b - a + 1) // (c - a) + (0 if (c % a == 0 and b % a != 0) else 1)
```

Explanation:
- `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` assigns the inputs to variables a, b, and c.
- `(b - a + 1)` calculates the number of integers between a and b inclusive.
- `(c - a)` calculates the number of multiples of c between a and b exclusive. The `+1` is added to include b in the range.
- `(c % a == 0)` checks if c is divisible by a.
- `(b % a != 0)` checks if b is not divisible by a, since we want to only count multiples of c that are also not divisible by a (i.e. those between a and b).
- `//` performs integer division.
- `(0 if ... else 1)` returns 0 if the condition `(c % a == 0 and b % a != 0)` is true, otherwise it returns 1 to account for multiples of c that are not in the range [a,b].
- The final result is printed.

The code does not use any loops or variables, which reduces its complexity. Instead of using `range()` and a conditional statement, we can perform all calculations with expressions and only call `print()`.
