x = int(input(""))
print(x ** 3)



The original Python program is a single line of code that takes input from the user and prints its cubic value to the console using the built-in power operator `**` in Python. You can reduce this code's lines by combining the two print statements into one as follows:

x = int(input(""))
print("The cubic value of", x, "is", x ** 3)
