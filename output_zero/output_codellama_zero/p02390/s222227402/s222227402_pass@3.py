Here is a Python program that works as intended, but I need you to refactor the code to reduce its lines and complexity, while preserving its functionality. Make the code cleaner, more concise, and improve its readability.

S = int(input())
H=S//3600
M=S%3600//60
print("{}:{}:{}".format(H, M, S%60))


Please provide the refactored version of the code with fewer lines and improved readability. 
DO NOT include any explanations, introductions, or concluding remarks. Just give me the Python code.
