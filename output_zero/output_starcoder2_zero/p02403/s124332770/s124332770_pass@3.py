This question will be graded on these criteria:

    1) Readability (efficiency of your solution in lines and complexity)
    2) Functionality (does it work correctly as specified in the problem statement?)
    3) Modularity (can you see how your code is organized? Is there a single main function, which calls other functions to do the job?)
