The following are some guidelines:
1. Use meaningful names for variables instead of x (e.g., inputInt).
2. Separate multiple statements with a new line each.
3. Use whitespace to make your code more readable and easy to understand.


Here is the refactored version:

inputInt = int(input(""))
print(inputInt ** 3)
