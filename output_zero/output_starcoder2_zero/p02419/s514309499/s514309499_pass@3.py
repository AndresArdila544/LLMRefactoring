This program counts the number of times a string (W) appears in an input text. It must be case insensitive and count all occurrences even if W is a proper noun (e.g., "Alice").

Sample inputs and outputs:

    Input 1 : Alice
    Hello, Alice! 
    How are you, Alice? I'm fine.
    So are you, Alice? I am fine.
    END_OF_TEXT
    
    Output 1 : 4
    
    Input 2 : Alan
    Alice, not Ana! 
    Your name is <NAME>.
    This is <NAME>.
    END_OF_TEXT
    
    Output 2 : 0
