I need you to refactor the following program:

c = 0
for i in range(int(input())):
    x = input()
    c += x[::-1] == x
print(c)



It needs to be improved by reducing its number of lines, making it more concise and readable. DO NOT include any explanations, introductions, or concluding remarks. Just give me the Python code.
