Refactoring Exercise #1
Write a function that takes in a string as input and returns another string as output where:

    Each word contains three characters except for the last word which contains one or more characters
    The words should be sorted alphabetically
    Vowels and consonants are not interchanged within words, but do change their order relative to each other

Example 1:
Input: I was walking my dog on a lake
Output: I wa walky a god myn oa alek

Example 2:
Input: It's just a fleeting thought in my mind
Output: It s'ts ejt a flentihg htwodm i nnmd

You may use any language you choose, but your code should not be more than one page long.
Please provide the refactored version of the code with fewer lines and improved readability.
