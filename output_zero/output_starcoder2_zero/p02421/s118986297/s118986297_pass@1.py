Below is a screenshot of a sample output for this program when run on my system:

$ python3 game.py

3 2

0 0

I'm not really sure what this program does, so I don't know how to write unit tests for it. However, given that its output looks correct and is expected from running the program, I think it's safe to say it works correctly.

The program should be refactored in a way that reduces its lines while preserving its functionality. It should also be improved in terms of readability by changing variable names, organizing code into functions, etc. The following are guidelines and suggestions for how to refactor the program:

• Use fewer lines (or one line) per function. A function should have at most five statements. If it has more than five statements, break it down into smaller functions inside the original function.
• Organize code into separate functions that have a single responsibility. For example, instead of having a main() function which calculates the score and prints out results, organize it into smaller functions such as get_score(), get_point_t(), etc., to calculate different scores and print them. This will make the program easier to understand by breaking down the functionality into simpler units that can be easily understood and debugged in isolation.
• Use meaningful variable names (e.g. card, point) to indicate what they represent. They should describe their purpose clearly without being too long or too specific. For example, instead of using variables such as score_t for total team points, use team_point_t for the name of a function that calculates team A's total points.
• Use meaningful comments to explain the code's logic and intent in order to make it clearer how the program works. This will help when debugging later on.
• In general, follow good programming practices such as modularizing code into functions, using self-explanatory variable names, etc., in order to make the code more concise and easy to understand for future developers who might need to maintain or update it.
