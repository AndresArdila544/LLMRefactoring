The original code already has the minimum number of lines required to execute the functionality. However, you can simplify it using a function and removing unnecessary code. Here's the refactored version:

```python
import math
def calculate_circles_area_perimeter():
    r = float(input())
    area = round(math.pi * math.pow(r, 2), 6)
    perimeter = round(math.pi * 2 * r, 6)
    print(area, perimeter)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    calculate_circles_area_perimeter()
```
This code will take the input radius of a circle and return its area and perimeter. The function `calculate_circles_area_perimeter()` takes the input for r, calculates the area and perimeter using `math.pi`, and then prints them rounded to 6 decimal places. The main function calls this function to get the output as required.
