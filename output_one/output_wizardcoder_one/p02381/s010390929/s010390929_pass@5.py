The given program calculates the standard deviation of a set of numbers entered by the user using `math.sqrt()` function. It first takes input for the number of elements in a list and then for each element it subtracts the average from it, squares it, appends to a new list A, and then calculates the sum of this list divided by length and finally takes its square root to get the standard deviation. 


Here's how you can refactor the code:


```python
import math

while True:
    n = int(input())
    if n == 0: break
    
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    A = [(x - sum(b) / n) ** 2 for x in b]
    print("{:.8f}".format(math.sqrt(sum(A) / len(A)))
```

Explanation: 
- We can use a list comprehension to calculate the square of each element of `b` and subtract it from the average, instead of using a separate loop.
- Instead of clearing A after printing, we just reassign an empty list to it before appending new values. This is more efficient than clearing and reusing the same variable.
- We can use `len()` function to get the length of the list instead of `n` variable.
