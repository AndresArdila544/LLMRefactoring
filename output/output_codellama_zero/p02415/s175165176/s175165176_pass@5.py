Here is a refactored version of the original program with fewer lines and improved readability:

x = input().swapcase()
print(x)

This version uses the built-in method `str.swapcase()` to swap the case of the string, rather than creating a new variable and using `str.upper()` and `str.lower()` separately. It also eliminates the unnecessary line where we print the original string.
