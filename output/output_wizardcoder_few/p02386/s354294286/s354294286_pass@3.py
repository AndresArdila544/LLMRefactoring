The original code has a few issues that need to be addressed in order for it to run correctly. Firstly, the given input is not consistent with the class definition of Dice, so the first input is being assigned to the wrong attribute (dice.a[n] should be dice.direction). Secondly, the program assumes that the two inputs after the initial one are integers, but they may contain letters as well. So I have modified the code below to use the string input as expected and added some comments to explain what is going on:

```python
class Dice:
    def __init__(self, directions):  # directions is a dictionary of possible directional shifts
        self.directions = directions
        self.dices = []  # initializes an empty list for the dices
    
    def roll(self, dice, dirs):
        """Roll the given dice in the specified direction and return the result."""
        shifted_dice = [dice[i] for i in self.directions[dirs]]  # shift the dice in the given direction
        self.dices.append(shifted_dice)  # append the new rolled dice to the list of dices
    
    def check_winning(self):
        """Check if all dices have the same values."""
        first = self.dices[0]  # assume the first dice is the target one
        for dice in self.dices:
            if dice != first:  # if any other dice has a different value, the game cannot be won
                return False
        return True  # otherwise all dices are equal, so the game can be won
    
# Read the input and create an instance of Dice with four initial values
n = int(input())
directions = {'S': (4, 0, 2, 3, 5, 1), 'N': (1, 5, 2, 3, 0), 'E': (3, 1, 0, 5, 4), 'W': (2, 1, 5, 0, 4), 'Y': (0, 3, 1, 4, 2)}
dice = Dice(directions)
t, f, r, l, b, u = map(int, input().split())
dice.roll([t, f, r, l, b, u])

# Read the remaining inputs and roll the dices
for i in range(1, n):
    a = list(map(str, input().split()))  # read the inputs as strings instead of ints
    dice.roll(*a)  # unpack the values to pass them as separate arguments to the roll method
    
# Check if any game can be won after rolling all dices
if dice.check_winning():
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

This code now uses a class to manage the dices and their possible shifts, and it checks for a winning condition at the end instead of iterating through each pair of dices. It also reads the inputs as strings instead of integers, which should fix any issues with letters being input.
