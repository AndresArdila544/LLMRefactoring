This is a refactored version of the given Python code to reduce its lines and complexity while preserving functionality. The original code can be simplified by removing the unnecessary variable `card_t` and using only one variable for `points`, which will store both values, `point_t` and `point_h`. Additionally, the loop is now used once instead of iterating over every card separately, improving performance.
