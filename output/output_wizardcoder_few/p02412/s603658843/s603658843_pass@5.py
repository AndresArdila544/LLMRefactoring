# The refactored version of the code is exactly the same as the original code, except that I have removed the unnecessary variable 'ab' and 'abc'. Instead of using two nested loops to calculate the sum of a + b and b + c, I have used only one loop to calculate the sum by adding them both together. The break statements in the if conditions have been simplified as well.

# However, this code still has an indentation error with 'break' statements that are not inside an 'if-else'. I have corrected it.
