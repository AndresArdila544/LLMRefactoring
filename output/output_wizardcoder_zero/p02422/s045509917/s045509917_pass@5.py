This is a more concise version of the original code, with all operations in one function, reducing the number of lines and improving readability.

Here's how it works:

- The `process_order()` function takes two arguments - the input string `t` and an integer `n`, representing the number of commands to follow.
- Inside the loop, we split each command into its respective parts using `.split()`, so that `orders[0]` represents the order (`replace` or `print`), `a` and `b` represent the start and end indices respectively for a replace operation, and `word` is the new word to insert during a replace operation.
- The first if statement checks which operation we are performing, and updates `t` accordingly. If it's a `replace`, we use slicing to insert the new word at index `a`, removing the characters from `b+1` onwards. Otherwise, we reverse the substring between `a` and `b`.
- Finally, the else condition handles the case where the order is not "print", as it was assumed that any other operation would be a "reverse". If it's a print operation, we extract the substring from index `a` to `b+1`, and print it.
```python
t = input() # input string
n = int(input()) # number of commands to follow
process_order(t, n)
```
