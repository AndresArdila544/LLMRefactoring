```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
print((b - a + 1) - sum(c % i == 0 for i in range(a, b+1)))
``` 

The original code uses `map` to convert the input string into integers and then initializes three variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. It loops through all numbers from `a` to `b`, incrementing a counter by 1 if `i` is divisible by `c`, and finally prints out the result.

The refactored code achieves the same functionality in fewer lines and with improved readability. Instead of initializing three variables, it uses tuple unpacking to extract the input values directly into the `a` and `b` variables. It then calculates the difference between `b` and `a`, adds 1 to account for the range being inclusive, and uses a generator expression with `sum` to count how many numbers from `a` to `b` have a remainder of 0 when divided by `c`. The result is printed out.
