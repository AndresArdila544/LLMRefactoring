```python
x = int(input())**3
print(x)
```

The original code takes an input and raises it to the power of 3 and then prints it as output. The refactored version uses a single line with the `print` function and uses exponentiation operator `**`. It also removes the unnecessary curly braces in the `format()` method call.
