```python
def check_circle(W, H, x, y, r):
    if all([x > 0, y > 0, x + r >= 0, y + r > 0, W - r - x >= 0, H - r - y >= 0]):
        return 'Yes'
    else:
        return 'No'
```

This code uses a function to check if the given parameters satisfy the conditions of the circle being inside the dimensions of the rectangle. The `all` function checks that all of the conditions are true, and then returns `'Yes'` or `'No'` based on the result.

It's more concise than the original version, which uses only a single line to check for multiple conditions, but it's still readable as one-liners usually are.
