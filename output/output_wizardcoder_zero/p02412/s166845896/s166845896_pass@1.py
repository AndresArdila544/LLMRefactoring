```python
def count_triplets(n):
    triplet_count = 0
    for a in range(1, n - 2):
        for b in range(a + 1, n - 1):
            for c in range(b + 1, n):
                if a + b + c == x:
                    triplet_count += 1
    return triplet_count
```

This version of the code is more concise and easier to read as it does not use the while loop. It initializes the count variable outside of the loops, which reduces the amount of lines used and simplifies the loops themselves.

The only change needed is to ensure that the function takes an argument for the value of n, which is the input value from user input. The if statement can be removed as it does not contribute to the functionality of the code. Instead, the triplet_count variable is incremented whenever the conditions are met.

```python
n = int(input())  # get user input for n
x = int(input())  # get user input for x
triplet_count = 0
for a in range(1, n - 2):
    for b in range(a + 1, n - 1):
        for c in range(b + 1, n):
            if a + b + c == x:
                triplet_count += 1
print(triplet_count)  # print the final count value
```
This version of the code is shorter and more efficient than the original because it only initializes variables once, uses less lines of code, and does not need to check for the exit condition with two separate if statements. The triplet count variable is incremented within the loops rather than being set to 0 initially. Additionally, n - 2 and n - 1 are used instead of n + 1 - 2 and n + 1 - 1, which simplifies the range functions.

Finally, the function can be added to allow for more flexibility when calling it with different values of n and x.
