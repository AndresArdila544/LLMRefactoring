Explanation: 
The original code calculates the number of combinations of three numbers (a, b, and c) that add up to x when all are less than or equal to n. It iterates over a in range [1,n-1] and for each a it checks if there exists another number (b) such that the sum of a + b + c = x. To achieve this, we can simply iterate over the possible values of b in range(a+1,n), check if c exists, and count the total number of combinations by adding to the count variable. The `sum` function is used to simplify the iteration process.

The refactored code replaces the nested loops with a single loop that iterates over all possible values of a in range(1,n) (since we don't need to iterate over b), and uses list comprehension to count the number of combinations for each value of a. The `if` statement checks if c exists by checking if `c > 0` and `c <= n`. If both conditions are met, it adds 1 to the count variable. Finally, we print out the total count at the end.

The refactored code is more concise, since we only need one line to declare a range object instead of nested loops and one line to iterate over the range. It's also faster because it avoids checking for duplicates (e.g., if x=5 and n=9, the original code would count 3+4 and 6+1 multiple times).
