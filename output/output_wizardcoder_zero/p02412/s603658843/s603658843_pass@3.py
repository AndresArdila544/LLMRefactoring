Explanation:
The original code iterates through all possible combinations of three numbers, a, b, and c that satisfy the condition a < b < c < n. It checks if ab + c equals x. If so, it increments the counter cnt by 1. This can be done more efficiently using nested loops and avoiding multiple variables.

The new code reads input from stdin until an empty line is encountered (signaling end of file). It then iterates through all possible pairs a and b less than n, and for each pair, checks if ab + c equals x. If it does, the counter cnt is incremented by 1. The while loop within the outer for loop can be replaced with an if statement that checks if abc < x and whether abc > a to avoid checking beyond x.

The use of map instead of split() allows for input to be read in one line at a time, reducing complexity. It also improves readability by using more descriptive variable names and avoids unnecessary operations on the numbers a and b.
