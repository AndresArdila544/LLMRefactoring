```python
while True:
    n = input()
    if n == '0 0': break
    x, y = map(int, n.split())
    print(y, ' ', x) if x > y else print(n)
```

This version of the code has reduced the number of lines and improved readability by using a ternary operator instead of an `if` statement to print the values as required. The `map()` function is also not needed, since it was only used for converting input strings into integers.

Another minor improvement would be to use f-strings to print the output, like so:
```python
while True:
    n = input()
    if n == '0 0': break
    x, y = map(int, n.split())
    print(f'{y} {x}' if x > y else n)
```
Note that this version will still work correctly because the `if` statement evaluates to a boolean value (`True` or `False`), which can be used directly as an expression in Python, but the ternary operator allows for a more concise way of writing it. The f-string format also improves readability by separating variables and their values with spaces, which is a common convention in Python code.
