"""
This program takes input from the user and calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers provided as input, where n is the number of elements in the list. 
If n = 0, it terminates the loop. The program then stores the calculated standard deviation in a list called "ans", and finally prints out the value for each element of the list using a for loop. 
The code is already functioning as intended but can be improved by reducing its complexity and readability.
