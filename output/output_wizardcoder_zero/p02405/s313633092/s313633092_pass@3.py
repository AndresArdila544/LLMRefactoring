Here is a refactored version of the original code that reduces its complexity and lines while preserving functionality:


for i in range(a):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print("." * b + ("#" * (b // 2))
    else:
        print("#" * (b // 2) + "." * b)

This is shorter and cleaner than the original code because it uses a single for loop instead of two separate loops. The // operator is used to calculate the integer division, which gives us half of the number of "#" characters in each line.

Note that I have also simplified the print statements by removing the unnecessary variable assignments "b_even" and "b_odd".
