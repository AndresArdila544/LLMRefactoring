```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
A = [[int(j) for j in input().split()] for i in range(n)] # use list comprehension to initialize A with values from user input
B = [int(input()) for _ in range(m)] # use a list comprehension to initialize B with values from user input
for row_A in A:
    res = sum(a * b for a, b in zip(row_A, B))  # use zip() function to iterate over corresponding elements of both lists simultaneously and multiply them, then store the result in res list
    print(*res)  # unpack the results using * operator and print each element on new line
```

Explanation:

The original program initializes two lists A and B. Then it iterates over rows of A, multiplies elements with corresponding elements from B and stores them in a separate list res. Finally, it prints the result for each row.

Refactored version uses list comprehensions to initialize both A and B and zip() function to iterate over two lists simultaneously. Then it multiplies the values using multiplication operator and store the result in res list. Finally, it unpacks the results and prints them on new lines using * operator.
