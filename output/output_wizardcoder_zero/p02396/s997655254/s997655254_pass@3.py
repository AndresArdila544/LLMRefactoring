```python
for i in range(1, int(input()) + 1): print("Case", i, ": ", input())
```

This is a more concise version of the original code that accomplishes the same task with fewer lines and improved readability. The while loop is replaced by a for loop that iterates `i` from 1 to an integer inputted by the user + 1, and then prints the input value for each iteration. The use of range() allows for a more concise syntax and cleaner code.
