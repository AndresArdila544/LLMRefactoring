```python
while True:
    H, W = map(int, input().split())
    if (H, W) == (0, 0):
        break
    print('#' * W for _ in range(H))
```

Explanation: The `for` loops can be replaced with a single print statement that prints the `#` character `W` times, once for each row. 
The loop iterates over `range(1, H+1)` to generate a sequence of integers from 1 to `H`, and the `_` is used as a throwaway variable in the loop to avoid error messages about unused variables. The print statement is then executed with the range as an argument, so that it will repeat the `#` character `W` times for each row. Additionally, the parentheses are not necessary since `range(H+1)` already returns the desired sequence of integers.

```python
print('\n'.join('#' * W for _ in range(H)))
``` 
Explanation: The `'\n'.join()` method is used to join each row of `#` characters with a newline character, creating a string that can be printed as one line for each row. This saves space and reduces the number of lines of code.
