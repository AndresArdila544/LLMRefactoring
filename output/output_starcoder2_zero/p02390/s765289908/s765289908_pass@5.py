Below is the original problem statement:

The goal in this problem is to implement the "Time Conversion" algorithm and then run it using a Python program. 

Given time in hours (hh, mm, ss), convert it to military (24-hour) time. 

Note: Midnight is 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock, and 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock. Noon is 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock, and 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock. 

Input Format 

A single string containing a time in -hh:mm:ss format, where 00 <= hh < 24.

Output Format 

Convert and print the given time in -hh:mm:ss format, where 00 <= hh < 24.
