Here is the correct solution that I've provided to you:

1. Here are some comments regarding your implementation:
- For better code readability, please use meaningful variable names (e.g., lstA).
- The 's' variable is not necessary and should be removed.
- The 's' variable can be replaced by the sum() function. See line 40 for an example.

2. Here are some comments regarding your implementation:
- You don't need to return all three values from the 'dist' function; you can just return one value (e.g., dist1).
- You can also rewrite the 'main' function with fewer lines, such as using list comprehension instead of multiple lines of code to assign variables. See lines 27 and 30 for an example.
- Your implementation of the 'main' function has several flaws in terms of readability and maintainability. For example:
  - You should use meaningful variable names (e.g., lstA).
  - Lines 19, 24, 28, 29, and 30 are repeated three times for each 'p' value. It is not very efficient to write the same lines multiple times when the code has similarities among them; a good idea would be to combine them into one line of code using list comprehension or tuple unpacking. See line 48 for an example.
  - Lines 37 and 38 can be merged into one. See line 50 for an example.
- The 'dist' function is not a very good name because it's not clear what the function does; ideally, it should have a better name such as 'calcDistance'.
- You can reduce the complexity of the 'dist' function by removing some unnecessary lines (e.g., line 12).

3. Here are the finalized refactored version of your code that I've provided to you:
def dist(A_lst, B_lst, p):
    return sum((abs(a - b) ** p for a, b in zip(A_lst, B_lst))) ** (1 / p)


N = int(input())
*A,  = map(int, input().split())
*B,  = map(int, input().split())
dist1 = dist(A, B, 1)
print("{:.6f}".format(dist1))
print("{:.6f}".format(dist(A, B, 2)))
print("{:.6f}".format(dist(A, B, 3)))
chebyshev = max((abs(a - b) for a, b in zip(A, B)))
print("{:.6f}".format(chebyshev))
