Below is the original prompt:

Write a program in Python that solves the following problem. You will be given an array of integers and a target value. 
Determine whether there are two integers in the array which sum to the given target value. If so, print them out. (If you can't find them, just print nothing). 
You may use each element as many times as necessary. There is no need to handle bad inputs. This problem has a solution of O(n) with hash tables, but we're looking for an O(n2) algorithm.


Here is the original input:

100 100 50 46 37 -1

Here are some example output lines:

-1
46 54
29 31
37 63
5 6
24 26
