Here is the original Python program:

a,b = map(int,input().split())
if a<b:
  print("a","<","b")
elif a == b:
  print("a","==","b")
else:
  print("a",">","b")


Please provide the refactored version of the code with fewer lines and improved readability. 
DO NOT include any explanations, introductions, or concluding remarks. Just give me the Python code.
