Below is a C program that works as intended, but I need you to refactor the code to reduce its lines and complexity, while preserving its functionality. Make the code cleaner, more concise, and improve its readability.

Here is the original C program:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int x=0; 
	scanf("%d",&x);
	printf("%d",(x*x*x));
	
	return 0;
}

Please provide the refactored version of the code with fewer lines and improved readability. 
DO NOT include any explanations, introductions, or concluding remarks. Just give me the C code.
