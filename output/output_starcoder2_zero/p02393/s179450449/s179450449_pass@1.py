Here is the expected output of the program:

Please provide a refactored version of the following code with fewer lines and improved readability. DO NOT include any explanations, introductions, or concluding remarks. Just give me the Python code.

Here is the original Python program:

a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
print(a[0], end ='')
for x in range(1, len(a)):
    print(" %d"  % a[x], end ='')


The expected output of the program is as follows:
