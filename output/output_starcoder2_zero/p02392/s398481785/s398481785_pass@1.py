Below is a textual representation of what the program should do. Please follow these steps to get the refactored version of the code:

1) Remove all leading and trailing spaces and empty lines (lines that consist solely of white space).
2) Replace all instances of "==" with "=".
3) Delete all occurrences of "\n". 
4) Convert all words into lowercase.
5) Remove all explanations, introductions, and concluding remarks.
6) Replace all occurrences of "-" (hyphens) with "_", e.g., remove_all.
7) Replace all occurrences of " " (spaces) with "__".
8) For each line of the refactored code:
     1) Split it into a list of words, delimited by "__"s.
     2) Remove all leading and trailing underscores (_).
     3) Convert each word in the list to lowercase.
     4) If the word is "import", delete it (but keep the double underscore after "import").
9) Replace all lines that are blank with a single underscore (_). 
10) Remove all double underscores (__). 
11) Replace each instance of "__" with "\n".
12) Make sure there aren't any leading or trailing spaces in the refactored code.
13) Print out the refactored version of the program, on a single line, starting with "a,b,c = map(int,input().split())\n", which is the first line of the original Python program.
