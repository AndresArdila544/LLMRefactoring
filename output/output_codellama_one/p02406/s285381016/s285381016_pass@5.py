Here is a refactoring version of your original program that reduces its complexity by using list comprehension:

n = int(input())
a = [x for x in range(1, n+1) if (x % 3 == 0 or x % 10 == 3)]
print(*a)

This version of the code is more concise and easier to read. It uses a list comprehension to generate the list of numbers that meet the criteria, and then prints those numbers using the `print` function with the `*` operator to unpack the list into separate arguments.
